# LAB[PO-101]_M01Lab09_Best_Practices_for_Project Operations Implementation

**Module:** 01 — From Sales to Project Operations  
**Lab Title:** Best Practices During Implementation  
**Estimated time:** 45–60 minutes  

## Lab overview
In this lab, you will explore **best practices for implementing Dynamics 365 Project Operations**. Unlike previous hands-on exercises, this lab focuses on *governance, methodology, and real-world guidance* to ensure successful adoption.

## Learning objectives
- Understand **methodologies** (Agile, Microsoft Catalyst, Sure Step).  
- Apply **data governance and security best practices**.  
- Learn how to manage **requirements, scope, and change requests**.  
- Establish **training and adoption strategies**.  
- Avoid common pitfalls in Project Ops implementations.  

## Prerequisites
- Completion of **Labs 1–8**.  
- Role: **Consultant, Solution Architect, or Project Manager**.  

## Scenario
You are part of a consulting team implementing Project Operations for a new client. Leadership wants to ensure the project is delivered on time, within budget, and aligned to best practices. You’ll explore strategies and apply them to a simulated project.

## Exercise 1: Methodology & Governance

1. **Review methodologies:**  
   - Agile/Scrum for iterative delivery.  
   - Microsoft Catalyst for envisioning and design.  
   - Sure Step for governance and risk management.  

2. **Task:** Document which methodology you would apply at each project phase:  
   - Sales & Pre-sales → Catalyst  
   - Implementation → Agile  
   - Governance & Quality → Sure Step  

**Validation:** You’ve mapped each phase to a recommended methodology.

## Exercise 2: Data Governance & Security

1. Define **data policies** for:  
   - Time & Expense entries.  
   - Invoice approval workflows.  
   - Resource role security (e.g., PM vs. Team Member).  

2. **Task:** Create a simple RACI (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed) for approving invoices.  

**Validation:** Roles and responsibilities for billing are clearly documented.

## Exercise 3: Requirements & Scope Management

1. During workshops, requirements should be logged in **DevOps / Azure Boards**.  
2. All changes must undergo **Fit-Gap analysis**.  
3. **Task:** For the Contoso ERP project, categorize the following as Fit or Gap:  
   - Standard Time Entry approval (Fit).  
   - Integration with legacy HR system (Gap).  

**Validation:** You classified requirements correctly.

## Exercise 4: Training & Adoption

1. Develop a **Train-the-Trainer** approach.  
2. Provide **role-based learning paths** (PM, Consultant, Resource, Finance).  
3. Use **sandbox environments** for user testing.  

**Task:** Draft a mini adoption plan with:  
   - Training sessions for end users.  
   - Executive reporting demos.  
   - Feedback collection (surveys, Teams channels).  

**Validation:** Adoption plan covers training, reporting, and feedback.  

---

## Exercise 5: Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Skipping fit-gap workshops → Leads to costly rework.  
- Not setting up **resource roles/skills** early → Resource scheduling fails.  
- Over-customization → Upgrade and support issues.  
- No executive sponsor → Adoption risks.  

**Task:** Write down 2 risks you think are most relevant for your client scenario and how you would mitigate them.  

**Validation:** Risks and mitigations are documented.  

---

## Results
You have:  
- Applied methodologies and governance models.  
- Practiced data governance and role security.  
- Classified requirements into Fit/Gaps.  
- Drafted an adoption plan.  
- Identified risks and mitigations.  

## Next steps
Proceed to **Module 02 (Advanced Scenarios)** for deeper coverage of integrations, multi-currency billing, and project portfolio management.
